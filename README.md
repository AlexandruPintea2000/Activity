> ## Education

I study at __Edinburgh Napier University__.

__Transylvania__ is my home county, so I studied there for 12 years.

I finished my studies at C.N.E.R, the __3rd most credited school nationally__.

During my final years, I've had a bunch of activities, such as:

1. __1st Prize NASA 2017__ 10th grade individual ([Website](https://www.wp-space-settlement.weebly.com))
2. __1st Prize at InfoEducatie__, a Google & Cisco sponsored national contest (I won by making the __1st Linux Launchpad__), called [Mb Launchpad](https://github.com/MusicBoard-Linux-Launchpad) (Made with __Cpp__ in __Qt__) . In the final round of the contest, I made a basic programming language (sort of), with a collague: visit [LFO](https://github.com/LfoProgramming)
2. __7 Months of Volunteering as an Assistant Programmer__ at Holisun
3. __1st Prize at an International Conference__
4. __Student of the Year__ in my last year of study.
